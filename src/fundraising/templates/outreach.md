Subject: Partner on a healing & ecological retreat in Coyote, NM?

Hi {{name}},

I’m {{sender}} ({{senderEmail}}), writing on behalf of Chanel & Eddie Marraccini.
We’re acquiring {{land}} to build a trauma-informed, eco-spiritual retreat that blends permaculture, family-friendly healing, and Earth-honoring practice — tags: {{tags}}.

We’re seeking aligned partners/donors to help close the land affordably and steward it long-term.
Ways to help now:
• Make a tax-deductible gift: one-time {{donateOnce}} or monthly {{donateRecurring}}
• Explore land-partner or bridge-fund terms (we repay over time)
• Introduce a funder or conservation ally who resonates

Project overview + photos: {{notionPage}}

If this aligns, I’d love to share our one-pager and talk specifics this week.

With gratitude,
{{sender}}
for Chanel Marraccini – Messy & Magnetic™
