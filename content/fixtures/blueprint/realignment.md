## Why You’re Here
You’re re-centering after a hard season or revisiting your map after time away.

## What to Re-Align
1) Nervous system care (sleep, hydration, light movement).
2) One priority to protect weekly.
3) Boundaries: one “no” you practice this month.

## Fast Wins
• 10-minute reset walk.
• 2-minute breath timer before decisions.
• Archive 3 “someday” tasks.

## Your Rhythm Reminders
AM: body before inbox. Midday: 60–90 min focus. PM: close loop ritual.

## Relationship/Household
Share energy levels once a week; plan chores by energy, not by day.

## Work Focus
Choose one theme for the week. Shipping small beats perfect.

## When You Feel Off
Tight chest, loops, rescuing others. First aid: water, move, one ask for help.

## Child-Friendly Version
Big feelings are normal. We’ll do tiny steps each day to feel safe again.
