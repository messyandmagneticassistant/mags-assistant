## Production Workflow
1. **Daily Trend Scan:**
   - Use TikTok Creative Center + TrendTok (if available) each morning.
   - Track top 10 audios within spirituality/wellness niche; log BPM, theme, optimal clip length.
2. **Shot List Creation:**
   - Pull raw clips from Drive folders (`/content/raw/*`).
   - When gaps exist, generate AI visuals via Runway/Midjourney (soft pastel, dreamy aesthetic) or record quick selfie clips.
3. **Editing & Captioning:**
   - Light overlays using CapCut; keep text within safe zones.
   - Add aesthetic captions; include 1-2 soft CTAs.
   - Replace any flagged/banned hashtags with trending safe alternatives (#spiritualtok, #softmanifesting).
4. **Quality & Compliance Check:**
   - Flag sensitive topics (trauma, health) and rewrite to gentle language.
   - Ensure no claims violate platform guidelines.
5. **Scheduling:**
   - Best performance windows observed: 11:11am, 3:33pm, 7:07pm local audience time.
   - Queue posts in automation tool; ensure at least one post hits each window.
6. **Booster Coordination:**
   - Distribute post links via internal Slack; specify comment copy + timing.
   - Monitor for natural interaction patterns (no repeated phrases, vary emoji usage).

## Flop Detection & Recovery
- Track 1-hour and 3-hour performance benchmarks: views < 40% of average or <2% engagement triggers review.
- Immediate actions:
  - Swap cover image/text overlay.
  - Recut into 9-12s punchier edit with tighter hook.
  - Reschedule for different time slot within 48 hours.
  - If content is valuable but format off, repurpose as carousel or story highlight.

## Analytics & Optimization
- Weekly dashboard: follower growth, reach, saves, profile visits, quiz click-through rate.
- A/B test CTAs ("peek," "tap," "unlock") and track conversion deltas.
- Correlate booster engagement windows with performance to refine schedule.
- Refresh hashtag bank weekly; maintain roster of 20 safe/trending tags.

## Traffic Drivers
- Pin high-converting Soul Blueprint explainer to profile.
- Integrate Link-in-bio funnel: Top slot Soul Blueprint quiz, second slot Magnet System.
- Use TikTok Stories for daily quick CTAs and behind-the-scenes coupon drops (24h flash code).
- Collaborate with micro-influencers (50k-150k followers) for blueprint testimonials; offer affiliate code.

## Community Management
- Respond to top comments within 30 minutes of posting where possible.
- Seed conversation prompts (“What did your last full moon reveal?”).
- Avoid overuse of direct purchase language; lean into curiosity and discovery.

## Weekly Ritual
- Monday: Trend audit + content calendar.
- Tuesday-Thursday: High-frequency posting & booster amplification.
- Friday: Live session teaser + live shopping practice.
- Weekend: User-generated content push, duet prompts, recap of Soul Blueprint wins.

## Risk Mitigation
