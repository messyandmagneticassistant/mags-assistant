# Blueprint Refinement

This layer turns raw chart data into language that feels human and approachable.

## Pipeline

1. Collect Astrology, Human Design, Numerology and other system outputs.
2. `renderDigestibleSections` converts each system into plain‑English passages.
3. `renderMosaic` stitches the passages together, highlighting overlaps and
   sacred numbers.
4. Options such as `childFriendly` or `ageGroup` adjust tone and metaphors.

The goal is roughly 8–15 pages per reading that are validating, magical and
readable by non‑experts.

## Example

**Before**
```
Sun trine Neptune in the 5th house.
```

**After**
```
Your creativity flows like water. Inspiration feels effortless and others are
drawn to the art you make.
```
